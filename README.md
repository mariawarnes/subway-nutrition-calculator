## Introduction
The **Subway Nutrition Calculator** is a web application designed to provide a user-friendly alternative to the official Subway nutritional calculator, which I find difficult to use, especially on mobile devices.

## Features
- **Calculate Macronutrients and Calories**: Quickly calculate the nutritional value of your Subway meal, focusing on macronutrients and total caloric intake.
- **Preset Menu Selections**: Use preset options to explore nutritional information for Subway's signature and saver series menus.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile use, ensuring you can access nutritional information on the go.
